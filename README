What is PSUnit
***********************************************************

This is a simple unit test frameworkk for powershell script. Right now, it support the following assert
	1. assertAreEqual
	2. assertGreater
	3. assertLess
	4. assertFail
	5. assertIsNone

***********************************************************
How to run the test script?
***********************************************************

Before running the test, please set up a environment variable first called "PSUNIT_HOME" what value is the folder of PSUnit.

Then you may run the test script like bellow
1) Start a command terminal
2) Go to PSUnit home folder
3) Execute the BAT file under the home folder called run_test.bat with one input argument what is the folder name include the test scripts you want to execute
4) Or you may run PowerScript directly, like
   PowerShell .\testRunner.ps1 [the folder name include test scripts]

PSUnit will find each PowerScript file (.ps1) under the folder provided recurvsely which file name match the pattern of "test*.ps1". And then it will execute all of the functions that match the patter of "function test*" in each script file.

***********************************************************
Example
***********************************************************

If your test scripte files are under the folder of C:\test, then you can run your tests like
	run_test.bat C:\test
Or
	PowerShell .\testRunner.ps1 c:\test

2. Tests examples
	File name: test_calculation.ps1
and in the script file to add functions to execute the tests, like
	
	Import-Module $env:PSUNIT_HOME"\asserts.psm1"

	function test_add()
	{
		$expected = 5
		$actual = 3 + 2
		assertAreEqual $expected $actual
	}

***********************************************************
Knowing Issues
***********************************************************

Right now, PSUnit cannot handle the comments in test scripts. So even if one function has been commented, like "# function test_add()", PSUnit will still run this test.
